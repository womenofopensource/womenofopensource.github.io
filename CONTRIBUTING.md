# Contributing to Women of Open Source

We warmly welcome contributions to the website, and we offer these guidelines to make a successful experience for everyone.

## Start by opening an issue

This is a great way to suggest a change, or to let us know you're working on something before you put in a lot of time. If you want to collaborate on something, people can see the issues and discuss there.

## Keep your changes small

Most pull requests should be reasonably small, so that we they can be reviewed and discussed in detail easily.

For example, if you add a new page about something, but then realise that there's some incorrect information on a different page, these should be two separate pull requests. It might be that the incorrect information can be accepted immediately, while we work on the structure of the new page. It's a simple example, but it stops one small and useful change being held up by other things in a large pull request.
