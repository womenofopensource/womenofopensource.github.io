# Women of Open Source

This repository holds the source for the Women of Open Source website.

## Overview

The site uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a Jekyll site with Markdown content.

## Project structure

Everything for the website is in the `docs/` folder (this is a GitHub default). Within this folder:

* General content belongs in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) format in files with a `.md` extension.

* To add something to the left hand navigation, edit the `_data/navigation.yml` file.

* The Jekyll configuration is in `_config.yml`.

## Running locally

For full instructions for your platform, visit the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site, but in summary:

* You will need Ruby and bundler installed

* Clone this repository to your computer, or if you've worked on the project before make sure your local copy is up to date

* Install the dependencies: `bundle install`

* To get the website running locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve` 
    * the command output tells you the URL to use in your browser to see the site, usually <http://127.0.0.1:4000>
