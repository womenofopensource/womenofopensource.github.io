# Women of Open Source

This community is offered to marginalized genders including women, women-identifying individuals, and non-binary and gender non-conforming people who are comfortable in a space that centers the experiences of women in open source. We recognize and acknowledge the intersection of race and gender identities and it is our hope that we can provide a community that is inclusive and accessible.

The community exists for us to gather, share ideas, and ask questions in a safe space. 

We will also share resources and updates publicly on our website for group members, allies, and anyone else who finds them useful.
